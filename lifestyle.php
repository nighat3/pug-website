            As with any pet, a pug can be a signficant added expense. Not only will you have to feed and care for your
            new furriend, but you will also have to anitcipate your pet's health costs and living costs. If you are
            unsure of whether or not you can afford a pug, think carefully before seeing a breeder or your pug, because
            it can be difficult to be practical once you see or choose your pet. This page contains tips on the
            additional things your pug might need to get comfortable in his or her daily life.

            <p class="pug-intro">
                Exercise is one of the most crucial aspects to maintaining the health and well-being of your pug.
                Closely watch your pug's diet and level of activity. It is best for your pug's health to walk at least
                once a day. You can take him/her out to the local dog park, a friend's house, or any other dog-friendly
                place!

            <p class="pug-intro">
                If your pug is young or a puppy, be sure to put them on a harness tied to a vest. This harness will help
                protect them from wandering off or getting hurt out on the street. Recommended vest brands include
                Puppia, which has vests available online through its website and Amazon. These vests come in a range of
                sizes, including small sizes for puppies and bigger sizes for adults.
            </p>

                You'll want to give your pug their space, which might include a playpen, a toybox, and of course, a bed.
                Be sure to read reviews about the comfort of the bed. Once you purchase the bed, check to see how your
                pug responds to the bed and how often he or she prefers to sleep in the bed. Here are some options
                available on Amazon:
