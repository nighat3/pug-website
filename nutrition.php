        <p class="pug-intro">
            When it comes to choosing food for your pug, it can be difficult to narrow down the best choice. A pug needs
            a healthy diet of carbohydrates, lean protein, and fats. You have many options to choose from, including wet
            and dry food, the occassional treat, and homemade meals.

        </p>

        <h2 class="about-subtitles"> Wet and Dry Packaged Food</h2>

        <p class="pug-intro"> Most pug parents opt for dry dog food. Brands such as Pedigree, Purina, Beneful, Blue
            Buffalo, and Royal Canin offer dry food for <em> small </em> breeds. These foods may have a healthy mix of
            real proteins and vegetables, which can be perfect for your pug. Every pug adapts to food differently and
            may have a specific preference for a brand, but it is crucial to purchase foods designed for small breeds.
            Food meant for larger breeds can be unsuitable for your pug - both in size and nutrients.
        </p>

        <p class="pug-intro"> Wet foods can also be an option for your pug. However, wet food can be loaded with extra
            calories and high sodium content. It is also prepared in ways less healthy for your pug. Your pug's
            consumption of wet food should stay minimal.

            <h2 class="about-subtitles"> Meals</h2>

            <p class="pug-intro">
                Depending on your pug's age (and assuming a healthy weight and rate of growth), this chart can serve as
                a rough guideline on when to feed your pug during the day. Your pug should consume roughly 1 cup of
                nutritious dry or wet food in a day. Depending on age, the size of your pug's stomach may be smaller and
                he/she may need more frequent meals to divide up the 1 cup.

            <h2 class="about-subtitles"> Homemade Food</h2>
            <p class="pug-intro">
                You can choose to cook your pug homemade food that is rich in lean protein, fats, and carbohydrates.
                Meats such as beef, turkey, chicken, and lamb are ideal, and vegetables such as carrots, peas, broccoli,
                and beans are always ideal for your pup.

            <h2 id="snackies-div" class="about-subtitles"> Snacks and Treats</h2>

            <p class="pug-intro">
                Whether you want to house-train your pug, make him or her do tricks, or improve their dental or physical
                health, treats and chewies can be a great way to reward your pup. Many varieties of treats online help
                improve dental health as well as bone-strength. Other varieties can serve as vitamins for your puppy.
                With other treats, it is imperative to be careful about portion control. Pugs ar especially skilled at
                making a puppy-dog face that will make you want to give them more treats, but you will have to develop
                good portion-control habits to keep your pug in shape. Here are some suggestions and brands designed for
                pug-like breeds:
