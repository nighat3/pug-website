## Submission

**Place an x between the [] after you have completed each step.** (example: [x])

- [x] I have checked that each resource included in my submission adheres to the course citation policy.

    Failure to adhere to the citation policy will result in a _minimum_ of a letter grade penalty for the assignment.

- [x] All of the code I am submitting is my own work.

    If you used other code as reference when writing your own code, please cite the resource via a comment.

- [x] **I have checked that my _entire_ submission has been pushed to Cornell's GitHub.**

    Failure to push to GitHub is the same as not submitting an assignment.

    Your assignment's **submission time** is the time of your **last push** and _not_ the time of your last commit (the dates next to commits in GitHub).

- [x] I am ready to have my assignment graded.

**Sign your name and include today's date and time to submit MILESTONE 2.**
