        <p class="pug-intro"> Wrinkly, short-snouted, and quirky, the Pug is a breed that originated during the Ming
            Dynasty in China. Brought to Europe shortly after and later embraced by Queen Victoria in the 19th century,
            Pugs are loving and loyal companions. Although mainly seen in black or fawn fur-coats, Pugs have silver,
            apricot, tan, and gray coats, and are often bred with other breeds. With big eyes, a muzzly face, and a
            stout body, pugs are prone to weight gain, infections, and other health concerns. With proper care and
            regular exercise, your pug can be as healthy as ever! </p>

        </p>

        <p class="pug-intro">
            Several important considerations should go into finding your pug. Do NOT support puppy mills or mall shops
            that are selling dogs - these operations do not treat animals well and force pure breeds like pug to
            reproduce at abnormal speeds. Even once a pug is born and in the care of these mills, they are kept in cages
            and display cases, and in many instances, not vaccinated or screened for diseases correctly.
        </p>
        <p class="pug-intro">
            Choose a breeder who you trust. You can do this by browsing carefully online, looking through reviews,
            asking friends and family, and consulting current pug parents on Instagram, Facebook, Redditt, and
            other social media platforms. Once you have narrowed down a few breeders, make sure to visit (more than
            once) to be sure their pugs are being treated well. If the breeders keep animals in cages or do not allow
            you to visit, do not engage with the breeder any further. Once you request or choose your pug puppy, be sure
            to visit and keep in touch regularly, and be sure you puppy is vaccinated (and perhaps even trained if that
            is what you want) before he/she leaves the breeder.
        </p>

        <p class="pug-intro">
            If you choose to adopt a rescue pug from a pug shelter, more power to you! All animals deserve the
            atmosphere and care of a loving home, so bringing home a pug who no longer has a home or loving pawrents
            will bond you two very closely. Search for local shelters or rescue services in your area to schedule a
            visit. Once you decide on a pug to rescue, it is imperative to ask yourself if you can fully support and
            anticipate the financial needs of your new dog. You can ask the shelter you choose for more advice on
            vaccinating, caring for, and feeding your pug.

            <p class="pug-intro">
                It is recommended that you wait until about six weeks to bring home your puppy. If you have already
                brought home a baby pug, spend time with him or her. A new pet needs a lot of love and attention when it
                comes home because your house can feel empty compared to your breeder's home. Plan to take at least one
                week off work if you work 40+ hour weeks or plan to hire a sitter to spend a few hours with the puppy.
                Be careful, however, because your puppy will form a crucial bond with you in the first few weeks, so
                being present yourself is essential. Buy your pug toys and let them explore their new surroundings.
                However, your pug might feel intimidated by too many places at once, so be sure to introduce him or her
                to new places (and new weather) gradually!
            </p>

            <p class="pug-intro">
                Depending on your breeder, your pug puppy may or may not be somewhat house trained. It is crucial to
                designate an area in your house for your pug. This area can have a bed, a box of toys, and other things
                that belong to your puppy. When it comes time for your pug to poop, use treats as incentives to train
                your puppy to go in a certain area. This area should not be outdoors if it is difficult to get to during
                harsher weather or is behind a closer door your puppy won't be able to open. Instead, designate one area
                (away from food or the kitchen) where your pug can be trained to go anytime. If you need help trianing
                your pug, train them at a puppy school nearby!
